// Round 9's third finding: the Hourly and Agents lanes had no retain-on-
// failure fold at all, so DashboardModel.FetchLazyWanted published
// `Hourly = hourly ? hourlyReport : s.Hourly` — a transient failure
// (hourlyReport is null because TryFetch swallowed a throw) overwrote a
// previously-good report with null. DashboardModel.cs itself is compiled by
// no test project (it opens with `using Microsoft.UI.Dispatching;`), so this
// is the seam that actually gets exercised.
//
// A third output, FetchFailed, and the previousFetchFailed input that fed it,
// were dropped later: every reader on the equivalence path that cared about
// "did the MOST RECENT attempt fail" already checked Value for retained data
// first, so once Value is non-null, deriving Failed-vs-Succeeded from
// Value is null alone reaches the same answer that output existed to correct
// — see DashboardModel.Snapshot.HourlyOutcome's own doc comment. The tests
// that existed only to pin that output are gone; the rest keep asserting the
// Value/Attempted behaviour that remains.
